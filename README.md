# Colorcrush

Colorcrush is a Unity mobile game where players must match colors to collect emoticons while learning about their ability to see colors! The game systems, including animation engine, audio engine, logging engine, and shader code, as well as Unity Editor functionality to aid development, were developed entirely from scratch. As a result, the project only relies on TextMesh Pro for text rendering and is entirely open source with a permissive license to redistribute. Have fun!
